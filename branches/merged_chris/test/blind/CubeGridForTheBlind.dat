TYPE

# for cube_grid environment, the args are:
#  cube_grid [X] [Y] [INIT_TYPE] [INIT_PARAM ... ]
#
#  where [X] = dimensions of the cube
#        [Y] = the discritization of each side (dL)
#        [INIT_TYPE] = string that gives the type of initialization
#                       supported types are UNIFORM, RANDOM
#        [INIT_PARAM] = extra parameters needed for the particular environment
#
#  for UNIFORM, parameters are:  1: concentration to start with in each voxel
#  for RANDOM,  parameters are:  1: number of sources
#                                2: min value of the source
#                                3: max value of the source
#
#
#  example:
#    cube_grid 4 0.5 UNIFORM 1
#
#    will create a cube environement of size 4x4x4, with a voxel size of 0.5x0.5x0.5.
#    thus, there will be (4/0.5)^3 = 512 voxels.  The nutrient will start with a uniform
#    concentration set to a value of 1.  (remember, concentration should range from 0 to
#    1 in nondimensional units.  Also note that if you change the discretization, without
#    changing any other parameter, it will effectively change the world size because of how
#    the blind agents consume from their world.  So if we change the discretization, then
#    we have to rescale the other parameters.  The easier way is just to pick the discretization
#    now, and never change it...).

CELLPOSITIONS

#all_same_position 1.0 1.0 1.0
#start all cells at the same position, given there

random_in_cube
#start cells randomly in the cube, requires that the environment is a cube_grid

# around_position 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0
# around_positon x y z r
# gives cells randomly positioned about the position
