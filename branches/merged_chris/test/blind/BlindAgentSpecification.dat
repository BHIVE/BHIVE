#  columns are:
#     type name      (any string you want)
#     velocity       (must be between 0 and 1 in nondimensional units)
#     cost for movement
#     max growth rate
#     Km               (note that substrate ranges from 0 to 1 always)
#     yield            (should be between 0.5 and 1)
#     death_threshold  (note that birth threshold is always 1)
#     initial_essence  (should be between death threshold and 1)
#     spontaneous death rate  (in units of probability per time unit)
#     rho         (cauchy distribution parameter, should be between 0 and 1)
#     is_levy     (set to 0 for exponential run length distribution
#                  set to 1 for power law (levy) run length distribution)
#     run length distribution parameter  (Beta for levy flights, gamma for exponential)
#     efficiency  this is the efficiency by which nutrient is depleted.  It is just a scaling
#                 factor for growth that will account for the spacing between voxels.  so if
#                 a cell wants to consume 0.5 units, it will only remove efficiency*0.5 units
#                 from the voxel it is in.
#     r1          cost of living.  in original normalized terms, this is always 1, but to get
#                 more interesting behavior, we can set this manually
#     birth threshold (in normalized units, this is set to 1)
#     number of cells
