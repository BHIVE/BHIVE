      Instructions for Testing HDF5 on Command Line
                         for Windows XP

************************************************************************
Note: This instruction is written for users who would like to test HDF5
      libraries and tools from the HDF5 source code package on the command
      line.
         
      We no longer support building HDF5 on command
      line with Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0.  Building Fortran libraries 
      from the commandline is not supported.  This is because building
      Fortran libraries requires Visual Studio .NET or 2005, which are
      also not supported on commandline.
      
      For all other Windows development tools, HDF5 should be built in
      the development environment.  Please refer to INSTALL_Windows.txt
      for detailed HDF5 building and installation information, or 
      INSTALL_Windows_short.txt for quick HDF5 building and installation
      instructions.
            
*****************************WARNINGS***********************************

Please read CAREFULLY about HDF5 build and install preconditions and 
notes in INSTALL_Windows.txt before starting below procedures.

************************************************************************

Extra Preconditions

   1. Add command line file-extraction support
   
      Option A. Winzip
         
          To use WinZip command line utility, you have to install 
          WinZip 9.0 or higher version.  You will also need the Winzip command
          line utility, which is free after the purchase of Winzip Pro

          If you want to extract hdf5\windows\all.zip on the command line,
          you should
       
          Step 1) Install WinZip command line support add-on 1.1
       
              Download WinZip command line support add-on 1.1 from 
              http://www.winzip.com and install it.
       
          Step 2) Add WinZip into environment path
       
              Open "System" in Control Panel.
              On the "Advanced" tab, click "Environment Variables", click
              "Path" in the "System variables" box, then click "Edit" and 
              add your WinZip path (For example C:\Program Files\WinZip)
              into "Variable Value" and click "OK".
  
      Option B. 7-Zip

          7-Zip is a free, open-source file archiver which supports
          unpacking zip file from the command line.  To use 7-Zip:

          Step 1) Install 7-Zip
          
             7-Zip is available online at http://www.7-zip.org/
             Please install the latest version available
         
          Step 2) Add 7-Zip to Path
          
             Open "System" in Control Panel.
   
             On the "Advanced" tab, click "Environment Variables", click "Path"
             in the "System variables" box, then click "Edit" and add your 7-Zip
             path (For example, C:\Program Files\7-Zip) into "Variable Value" 
             and click "OK".


      Note: 
         You can also extract all.zip from interactive WinZip or 7-Zip interface 
         without the above steps.

***********************************************************************
Step 1. Testing HDF5 libraries and tools

   1. Unpack all.zip

      Unpack all.zip in c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\windows into the 
      C:\myHDFstuff\hdf5\ directory.
      
      This can be done with either of the following 3 options:

      Option A. Unpack from the interactive WinZip or 7-Zip interface

      Option B. Unpack on the command line with WinZip

         cd into the c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\windows directory
   
         type: wzunzip -yO -d -o all.zip c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5

      Option C. Unpack on the command line with 7-Zip
      
         Open a command prompt and navigate the the directory
         C:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\windows  Then run the command:
         
            7z x all.zip -o..\ -y

         This will extract all windows files into the c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5
         directory.
   
  
   2. Build HDF5 using Visual Studio .NET or 2005. For detailed HDF5 build and 
	   install information, please refer to INSTALL_Windows.txt for further information.

   3. Test
         We also provide users with the option to test 
         HDF5 libraries and tools seperately.
   
         Test HDF5 Libraries and Tools
   
            A batch file named hdf5check.bat in c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5
            directory is provided for users to test HDF5 library 
            and tools from command line.

         You may use the following options:

               hdf5check                 test HDF5 C library and tools
      
               hdf5check enablecpp       test HDF5 C/C++ libraries 
                                         and tools
      
            Invoke a command prompt window and run hdf5check with 
            appropriate options.

            Test results are saved in two files:

               c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\tests_results.txt   

               c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\check_results.txt.

            In general, you only need to check tests_results.txt.  If
            all the tests passed, then you do not have to check 
            check_results.txt. If some tests failed, check 
            check_results.txt can help you figure out what was wrong.


   
STEP 2: Installing HDF5 Libraries

Run the batch file c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\installhdf5lib.bat to install all
HDF5 libraries and tools into c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\hdf5lib directory.
