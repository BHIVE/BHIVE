	//!  Maintains a set of Transformation objects for a ReactionClass
	/*!
	 	This class is one of the core pieces of a ReactionClass.  It maintains the
	 	set of Transformation objects for each of the reactants in the ReactionClass.
	 	Therefore, it knows about the TemplateMolecules of the ReactionClass; it knows
	 	how to generate MappingSet objects for the ReactantLists; it knows how to
	 	create MappingGenerator objects for TemplateMolecules; it knows how to execute
	 	the set of Transformations; and finally, it knows how to generate the list of
	 	product molecules that are generated from firing a reaction rule.  To use this
	 	class, first create your TemplateMolecule objects for your ReactionClass.  Create
	 	a TransformationSet from the TemplateMolecule vector (the vector should be created
	 	such that each element of the vector is a reactant in the ReactionClass).  Add
	 	as many Transformations to the set as you like using the TransformationSet static
	 	functions.  Finally, call the finalize() function to finish setting upt the
	 	TransformationSet.  Then you can use this TransformationSet to create a ReactionClass
	 	with ease.  Really, this is all easier than it sounds! (see simple_system.hh and
	 	simple_system.cpp )
