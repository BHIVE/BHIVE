==========================================
==  Priority Updates
==========================================

 * Incorporate ODE solver library
 * Add new simulators and default agent factories for BNG based ODE and SSA simulation

 * Figure out the best way to add agents to simulators.  Shouldn't they always be added
   when a simulator is created?  If not, we should standardize when agents are added to
   a simulator.

 * Add the ability to load projects from a library that calls hive functions
 
 * Add a default input file / input format that automatically parses and returns a map








==========================================
==  Performance Updates
==========================================

 * Switch Database representation of Data elements from Map to an indexed-array, but keep
   the map around for matching Data names (which we now use as unique identifiers of data)
   to array index locations (which should not change during a simulation).  this will save
   computation time during each time step when database elements are accessed.
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
==========================================
==  Design issues to ponder
==========================================

 * Should messages know who sent them, or should they be anonymous?  In some cases, the reciever
   needs to know who sent the message, for instance, when a cell agent notifies the world that
   its position must be changed.  Now this return address must be part of the Data message being
   sent.  This minimizes the information that is sent with a message because you only send the
   message author agent when needed instead of every time.  however, this also introduces a possible
   source of errors if you forget to or do not properly sign your message when it is generated.
   So then, should messages enforce this adding slightly more to each message, or should messages
   remain anonymous to be only signed in needed?
