# this is a metafile for specifying the simulation
# comments are given by the lattenzaun 
# for testing the diffusion we do some simulations for c.
# namely diffusion of odors.

# flags for the simulation. although we won't have any cells in the 
# simulation we need to specify the celltype. i will change this in 
# a later version. 
FLAGS
# specifying which cell type will be used in the simulation. the value 
# can either be ecoli or blindagent. the value is followed by the filename 
# specifying the parameters for the agent initialiser.  
CELLTYPE ecoli /home/jentsch/workspace/chemotaxisPopulation2/nocells.dat
# specifying whether metabolism will be modeled
END

# we need to specify the environmenttype 
ENVIRONMENTTYPE
# the environmenttype is a grid
GRID
# in particular a microfluidic grid with a resolution of 0.1 cm and file specifying the geometry and initial ligand concentration 
# of a ligand with Diffusion coefficient of 0.08 cm**2/sec 
MICROFLUIDIC 0.1 /home/jentsch/workspace/chemotaxisPopulation2/comp_geo.dat /home/jentsch/workspace/chemotaxisPopulation2/comp_init.dat 0.08
END
END

# next we specify the initial cell positions: we do not need to do this here 
# as there are no cells in this simulation
# CELL_POSITIONS
# read initial cell positions from the file below
# FROM_FILE_FOR_MICROFLUIDIC /home/jentsch/workspace/chemotaxisPopulation2/cellsmicrotest.txt
# END

# finally we specify the number of steps. 
NUM_STEPS
# we want to simulate the system for 5 minutes. hence there will be 3000 
# steps of length 0.1 sec. the initial local world time is 0.0 and no time
# for equilibration is needed.
6000 0.05 0.0 0.0
