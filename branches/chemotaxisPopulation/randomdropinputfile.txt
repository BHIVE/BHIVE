# flags for the simulation
FLAGS
# specifying which cell type will be used. this can either
# take on the value ecoli or blindagent. this is followed by the 
# filename that the agent initialiser will be using 
CELLTYPE ecoli /home/jentsch/workspace/chemotaxisPopulation2/cellfileIII.dat
# specifying whether metabolism will be modeled. currently we only
# have a single metabolism model availabe which is called simple.
# CELL_HAS_METABOLISM simple
END

# first we specify the environmenttype 
ENVIRONMENTTYPE
# which is a simulator
SIMULATOR
# rds with time parameter, space parameter, mu, sigma, and D. mu and sigma
# are used for determining the initial value of a new drop according to a
# a log normal distribution. the last item is a flag can be used to switch 
# this off. hence, if this flag is set to FALSE, the initial value will always
# be equal to mu. 
RANDOM_DROP_SIMULATOR 10.0 10.0 1 1 10 FALSE
END
END

# next we specify the initial cell positions
CELL_POSITIONS
# initialise all cell positions around same position x,y,z within a radius
# r, set total number of cells to number.
AROUND_POSITION 0.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 10
END

# finally we specify the time steps 
NUM_STEPS
# there will be 1000 steps of length 0.1 local world time is 0.0 
# and equilibration time is equal to 10.0
1000 0.1 0.0 10.0
