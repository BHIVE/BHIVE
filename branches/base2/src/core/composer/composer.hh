	 *
	 * the composer sets up the entire simulation by coordinating all file reading,
	 * agent construction and agent initialisation. the setup of a simulation starts
	 * with the initialisation of the agentfactories. subsequently the agents are produced
	 * and the hierarchy among the agents is established.
